# Part 5: Version 2.0
Version 2.0 "Design is iterative. Ideas need to incubate." -Professor P. Colin Manikoth | Web 2 | Winter 2020

## Revisions to Project
- Went through most of the code for quality control, syntax, & ensure credits for a number of elements I borrowed from other designers/developers and adapted as applicable to this project
- Recompiled all of the media queries (wide desktop, desktop, tablet and mobile) as there were so many issues it was easier to just start over
- Made adjustments to the #trailer container's large BG image so the main graphic pattern (black & white checkers and diamonds) shows enough on both sides of the .plyr video player as it is effective when viewing the video in creating a sense you're somewhat immersed in the thematic elements of the cult flick. I set the image at the size & perspective needed to blend/reflect what the same patterns showed as the trailer plays
- Stayed with the single column, top-down layout as I think it has the best impact when viewed from the top down versus left to right or diagonal w/other layouts with 1 exception: the add'l sources/movie info links + official movie poster are 2 column until flex direction change for smaller screens. Also, made sure center the section heads. 
- Resisted the tempation to add more stuff / "decorate" as I really think it's just right - anymore will get annoying &/or reduce impact of each section.  

## Future Revisions & Plan for Web 3 in the Fall 2020:
I want to totally re-design it between now or during Web 3 when I take it next Fall 2020 (using the tools introduced toward end of this course). But first, I decided to post-pone Web 3 so that I can use the spring + summer to get more proficient w/code, especially javascript + practice as many layouts & features we were exposed to that I've saved/linked/staged for later. I really struggled w/the animations phase & pretty much all the Js stuff -- wasn't anything wrong w/the instruction, in fact, it was the instruction & all the tips, examples, walk-throughs & links to the tools (eg, the Web 2 projects site) that got me through. 


So, for Web 3, I want to have a head start so the quality, timing and execution are a lot better which will enable me to make better contributions to the design process, project collaboration, teamwork/assisting others & of course better end products -- a win-win. 

*Thank you for everything you shared -- I have treasure trove of HTML, CSS & Js goodies organized & ready to keep me learning & iterating until return for Web 3 in the Fall!*

# The Big Lebowski

## Description

Is a “crime comedy” film written, produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, aka, “The Coen Brothers.” The story takes place in 1990 and stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski who’s a lazy, pot-smoking, White-Russian sipping, bermuda short wearing, unemployed bowler who is mistaken for another “Lebowski” who owes money to some thugs who urinate on his beloved rug -- "it really tied the room together" -- in an attempt to collect some debt he’s completely unaware of. But, in the midst of that he finds out that the intended “Lebowski” has the same name and is rich so he sets out trying to get compensated for his rug. When he finds and confronts the rich Jeffrey Lebowski, the Dude is offered a high paying deal if he can find his kidnapped wife and deliver the ransom. But, everything goes nutty in the process and the rest is spoilers.. Not matter what: "the Dude is like the tumbleweed" in the opening sequence: "just going with the flow...".
