# The Big Lebowski

## Description

Is a “crime comedy” film written, produced and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, aka, “The Coen Brothers.” The story takes place in 1990 and stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski who’s a lazy, pot-smoking, White-Russian sipping, bermuda short wearing, unemployed bowler who is mistaken for another “Lebowski” who owes money to some thugs who urinate on his beloved rug -- "it really tied the room together" -- in an attempt to collect some debt he’s completely unaware of. But, in the midst of that he finds out that the intended “Lebowski” has the same name and is rich so he sets out trying to get compensated for his rug. When he finds and confronts the rich Jeffrey Lebowski, the Dude is offered a high paying deal if he can find his kidnapped wife and deliver the ransom. But, everything goes nutty in the process and the rest is spoilers.. Not matter what: "the Dude is like the tumbleweed" in the opening sequence: "just going with the flow...".
